Additionally, the player is able to randomize the bosses found at the end of boss stages, the order of stages,
the world they start in, the starting amount of lives, route through 6-8, and the color of Yoshi for each stage.

## What is the goal of Super Mario World when randomized?

The player can choose one of two goals
- Bowser: Defeat a pre-defined number of bosses, and defeat Bowser at the end of 6-8.
- Luigi Hunt: Collect a pre-defined number of 'Pieces of Luigi' within levels.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Locations consist of 'level objectives', that being:
- Beating the stage
- Collecting 20 red coins.
- Collecting 5 flowers.
- Collecting 30 stars.
Checks will be sent immediately upon achieving that objective, regardless of if the stage is cleared or not.
Additional checks can be placed on Bandit mini-battles, or overworld minigames.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
