# Soul Blazer

## Where is the options page?

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What is the goal of Soul Blazer when randomized?

Your goal is to make it to the end of the game and defeat Death Toll to do this you will need:
- Each key NPC that will unlock the next world
- All 6 Stones for access to the World of Evil
- The Soul Blade, Soul Armor, and Phoenix magic
- The three Red-Hot items
- ... and whatever else logic dictates

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All treasure chests, lair releases, and NPC rewards have been shuffled into the pool.
None of the souls, such as the Magician's Soul at the start of the game, are shuffled.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.
