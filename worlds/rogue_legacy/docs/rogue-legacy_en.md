## So... how do I install this?

## So... what is Rogue Legacy Randomizer?

Check out the [Game Info page](/games/Rogue%20Legacy/info/en) for more information about Rogue Legacy Randomizer.

## So... how do I create settings?

You will need to generate a player config file that provides the generator with the necessary information about how it 
should generate the game. Each player in the multiworld should provide their own settings file. This setup allows each 
player to enjoy an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have 
different options.

For additional information on "Archipelago" check out the [Archipelago setup guides](/tutorial/#Archipelago).

### Where do I get a player settings file?

You can create your settings files by visiting the [Rogue Legacy Settings Page](/games/Rogue%20Legacy/player-settings).
From there, you can either create a single player game by clicking "Generate Game" or you can output a settings file for
multiplayer games by clicking "Export Settings" and providing it to the game host to generate.

### How do I connect to the Archipelago server?

Once in-game, press the start button and enter the hostname, port, your slot name, and room password (if applicable).
Then select "Connect" and confirm on the "Ready to Start" prompt. You should then connect to the server and start the
game.
